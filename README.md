# The REM Project  
![Logo Animation](./docs/design/logo.png)

**The REM Project** is an atmospheric narrative prototype built with Three.js, exploring the blurry edges between memory, dream, and distorted perception.  
You enter a fragmented world shaped by childhood echoes and the shadow of a forgotten sleep study called **SOMNA**.

> _This project was created as part of a university course. It's not a finished game – but a solid foundation for a larger, interactive experience._

## ✨ What to Expect

In its current state, the game includes:

-  A **clickable menu**
-  A **fully playable first room** with interactive puzzles, sound & narration 
-  **Two custom-cutscenes** that hint at the story’s deeper layers
-  A **second room** featuring further interactions and a memory-based quiz

You’ll interact with objects, uncover strange fragments, and be guided by a cryptic, sometimes sassy narrator — all while trying to piece together who you were… and what happened.


## Story Overview

> After weeks of insomnia,  
> you signed up for a study.  
> They said it was a therapy.  
> Something experimental — but promising.  
>  
> They said you’d finally sleep.  
>  
> But now you're somewhere else.  
> Between memory and dream.  
> Everything feels real — and wrong.  
>  
> A turquoise glow follows you.  
> A voice keeps whispering.  
> Fragments return. Others fade.  
>  
> **Find your way back.**  
> Or deeper in.  
> Before you forget who you were.

## 🪼 The REM Substance

At the core of the SOMNA experiment lies a rare, forbidden substance — a psychoactive extract derived from mysterious, deep-sea jellyfish.  
Known only to select researchers and shadowy organizations, this **turquoise glowing extract** was designed to intensify REM sleep and open doors to hidden layers of consciousness.


The REM Substance is your connection to this dream logic reality — and your only clue to escaping it.
